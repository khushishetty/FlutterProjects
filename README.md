Internship Journey:
The internship was on Flutter App development. I learnt about building natively compiled applications for mobile, web desktop and embedded devices using Flutter.

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit to build applications for various devices using a single codebase. I learnt about the importance of Flutter, why it is used and also learnt its basic implemention hands on.

I worked on a single page user profile application and also a real time News application, which fetches data using the news api. I learnt various concepts on designing, use of various widgets that flutter offers, how api is fetched and used, how we can add multiple pages to a single app and so on.
